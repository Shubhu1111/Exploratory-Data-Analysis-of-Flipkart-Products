# Exploratory Data Analysis of Flipkart Products

Flipkart, founded in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, two former Amazon employees, is currently the biggest E-commerce website in India. Initially, Flipkart was a platform for selling books, but it later expanded to include other products like electronics, clothing, and various other consumables. This exploratory analysis aims to gain insights into Flipkart's monthly sales data, analyze product discounts and identify trends, and determine which product categories performed better in terms of sales.

## Objectives

The objectives of this analysis are as follows:

- To explore the structure of the data
- To identify any patterns within the data
- To investigate missing values and address any issues related to them
- To prepare the data for analysis
- To gain insights into the monthly sales data
- To analyze the discounts on products and identify any trends
- To determine which product categories performed better in terms of sales.

## Data Wrangling

Cleaning data is a crucial step before EDA, as it will remove the ambiguous data that can affect the outcome of EDA. While cleaning data, we will perform the following steps:

1. Remove duplicate rows
2. Handling missing values
3. Convert columns to appropriate datatypes
4. Adding important columns

## Libraries Used

In this exploratory analysis, the following libraries have been used:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Graphs and Plots Used

The following graphs and plots have been used, along with their descriptions:

1. Heatmap: A graphical representation of data where the individual values are represented as colors on a matrix. Heatmaps are commonly used to visualize large datasets and identify patterns or correlations within the data.

2. Barplot: A graph that uses rectangular bars to represent the values of variables. Barplots are commonly used to compare the values of different categories or groups of data.

3. Pie Chart: A circular graph that is divided into sectors, each representing a proportion of the whole. Pie charts are commonly used to show the relative sizes of different parts of a dataset.

4. Line Chart: A graph that displays data as a series of data points connected by lines. Line charts are commonly used to show trends or changes in data over time, and to compare the values of different variables.

## Analysis Objectives

The following objectives will be explored in the analysis:

- What is the costliest product sold?
- What is the cheapest product sold?
- Which product sold at the highest discount?
- How are the discounts provided based on categories?
- How are the sales distributed across time periods (yearly and monthly)?
